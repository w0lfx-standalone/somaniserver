# v1.4 – Setting up Seafile

## Highlights:
- Deployed Seafile on Ubuntu Server VM for private, modular file syncing
- Integrated TrueNAS ZFS pool via NFS share for persistent storage
- Configured Docker containers for Seafile and its dependencies (MariaDB)
- Applied UID/GID mapping (3000:3001) for consistent access across VMs and containers
- Enabled persistent volumes for Seafile data and database
- Created a systemd service to manage the Seafile stack automatically
- Verified file syncing, container persistence, and auto-start functionality

## Why it matters:
- Seafile is now fully operational, providing a reliable and private file-syncing solution
- All data is securely stored on the redundant ZFS mirror, safeguarding against drive failure
- The server stack now includes both a photo management platform (Immich) and a file-syncing platform (Seafile), creating a comprehensive personal cloud.
